# Leaf classification
*Machine Learning project - Master Degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing*

The purpose of this project is to implement an automatic method to classify certain leaves based on some of their attributes. The leaves and attributes
considered are contained in a publicly available dataset. In other words, the goal is to build a model that can predict the species of a leaf given its attributes. Thus, the input of the model is a numerical vector and its output is a label related to one of the species in the dataset.

The goal is to propose a method for leaf identification based on the provided leaf attributes and using a proper unsupervised or supervised learning tool.
The proposed solution is to grow a **Random Forest** (RF) from the provided data. This choice is dictated by the fact that an RF is a common algorithm implemented in many different packages and libraries and generally performs well.
